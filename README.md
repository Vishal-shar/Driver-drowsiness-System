Driver Drowsiness Detection System: Built a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using CNN and OpenCV that monitors eye state from a live camera feed and triggers alerts when signs of fatigue are detected, helping to reduce the risk of road accidents.
This project is a real-time Driver Drowsiness Detection system that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and OpenCV to detect whether a driver’s eyes are open or closed. If drowsiness is detected for a certain duration, the system raises an alert, making it useful as a safety-assistance feature to prevent accidents caused by fatigue.
